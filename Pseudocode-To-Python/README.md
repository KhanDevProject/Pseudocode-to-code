# About the application 
This Python app defines a function sort_and_find_median(numbers) that sorts a list of numbers using the bubble sort algorithm and then calculates the median value. 
It also includes a helper function sort(numbers) to perform the sorting. The program prompts the user to input a list of numbers separated by spaces, processes the input, calculates the median using the defined functions, and prints the result.
